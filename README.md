# RPi-PICO-Water-Level-Switch
This project provides a solution for automated water pump control and monitoring using a Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller and an SSD1306 OLED display. Designed to manage water levels efficiently, the system ensures that your water pump operates only when necessary, avoiding frequent on/off cycles that can cause wear and tear.
